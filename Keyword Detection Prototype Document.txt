Keyword Detection prototpe Documentation:


Objective:
This research documentation is a practical demonstration of keyword detection for a voice-based conversation using Python. 
Libraries Used:
The following Python libraries were utilized in this project:
- `speech_recognition`: This library was used for audio processing and speech recognition. It allows you to work with audio data and convert it into text.
- `PyAudio`: This library is commonly used for audio input/output and was likely the intended library, as "condaaudio" is not widely recognized.

Code Description:
The provided Python code demonstrates keyword detection in an audio file using the `speech_recognition` library along with `PyAudio`. Here's a breakdown of the code:

1. Importing the required libraries, including `speech_recognition` and `PyAudio`.
2. Initializing the `speech_recognition` recognizer.
3. Loading an audio file named 'speech_file.flac'.
4. Using the recognizer to listen to the audio and attempt speech recognition using Google's speech recognition service.
5. If recognition is successful, the recognized text is printed.
6. Punctuation removal and text conversion to lowercase are performed.
7. The text is split into words, and the frequency of each word is counted.
8. Finally, the word frequencies are printed.

This code provides an example of how to transcribe speech from an audio file and perform basic text analysis on the transcribed text.

Conclusion:
This project offers practical experience in working with audio data and text processing using Python. It can be a valuable learning resource for  students, especially those interested in natural language processing and speech recognition.
